# Credit Card Fraud Detection with TensorFlow (Deep Learning):

  This project implements a deep learning model using TensorFlow Functional API to detect fraudulent transactions from credit card data. The solution focuses on handling class imbalance, feature normalization, and real-world model evaluation metrics like AUC, Precision, and Recall.


# Overview:

Fraud detection is a high-impact area of data science involving highly imbalanced classification. This project targets binary classification to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0) based on anonymized features.

# Dataset:

  Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download

  Rows: 284,807 transactions

  Frauds: ~492 (~0.17% of total)

  Features:
    * 28 anonymized PCA-like features (V1 to V28)
    * Amount, Time (preprocessed)
    * Class: Target label (0 = Legit, 1 = Fraud)

# Model Architecture:

Built with TensorFlow 2.x Functional API:

    Input (normalized)
           â†“
    Dense(128) â†’ BatchNorm â†’ Dropout(0.5)
           â†“
    Dense(64) â†’ Dropout(0.3)
           â†“
    Output Layer (Sigmoid)
    
  Activation: ReLU (hidden), Sigmoid (output)

  Loss: Binary Crossentropy
  
  Optimizer: Adam
  
  Metrics: AUC, Precision, Recall

# Pipeline Steps:

  | Step                   | Description                                              |
  | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **1. Data Cleaning**   | Drop `Time`, log-transform `Amount`                      |
  | **2. Splitting**       | Train (70%) / Val (15%) / Test (15%) with stratification |
  | **3. Input Pipeline**  | Use `tf.data.Dataset` with prefetch and batching         |
  | **4. Feature Scaling** | Apply `tf.keras.layers.Normalization()` per feature      |
  | **5. Model Training**  | With `EarlyStopping` on validation AUC                   |
  | **6. Evaluation**      | Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, ROC AUC         |


# Evaluation Metrics:

  | Metric                | Value |
  | --------------------- | ----- |
  | **ROC AUC Score**     | 0.97  |
  | **Precision (Fraud)** | 0.92  |
  | **Recall (Fraud)**    | 0.77  |
  | **F1-Score (Fraud)**  | 0.84  |
